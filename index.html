            The Netflix Kids experience is included in your membership to give
            parents control while kids enjoy family-friendly TV shows and films
            in their own space. Kids profiles come with PIN-protected parental
            controls that let you restrict the maturity rating of content kids
            can watch and block specific titles you don’t want kids to see.
